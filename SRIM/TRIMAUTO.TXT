TRIM Monte Carlo calculations can be run without any keyboard inputs. This allows TRIM to be run with sequential calculations for a group of related results (sometimes called "running in a batch mode").

INSTRUCTIONS:
Look at the file: TRIMAUTO which contains one number.
If the number is 0, then TRIM runs normally.
If the number is 1, then TRIM runs without keyboard input.
If the number is 2, then TRIM resumes running its last saved calculation.

The second line of TRIMAUTO sets the path to the data (blank if default SRIM directory)

Running TRIM in batch mode:
(1) Edit TRIM.IN to for the desired calculation.
    Be sure to edit line #3, Ion Number, to the total ions to be calculated.
    Be sure to edit line #7 to obtain the desired output files.
    Be sure to edit line #13 to Plot Type = 5 (no plots) for the fastest calculation.
       Set Plot Type = 1-4 to monitor plots during the calculation.
(2) Copy TRIM.EXE from the "Programs" sub-directory to the main SRIM directory.
        Execute TRIM.EXE. 
	NOTE: You must reset your Batch Software default directory the SRIM directory so that 
	TRIM may find its data files. Various codes do this in different ways. For example, 
	in Visual Basic you would execute TRIM from your Batch Software using the lines:
	ChDir "C:\Program Files\SRIM 2003\"
	Shell "C:\Program Files\SRIM 2003\TRIM.exe"
(3) You may view any plots during the TRIM calculation.
(4) When TRIM is completed, save or rename all the *.TXT files which contain the output.
(5) Repeat as needed

You will obtain all output files requested in TRIM.IN, line #7, plus two special groups:
  *.TXT = Files containing all the data shown in the available plots
  *.SAV = Files allowing the restart of TRIM where the last calculation stopped.

You will have to alter file TDATA.SAV, Line #10, "Ion Number Total" to a bigger number
in order to continue calculations with TRIM using old data.
