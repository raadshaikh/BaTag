LED pulser board placed at bottom of detector cross, which was placed in dark box.
LED channels:
0,1 = 470 nm
2,3 = 405 nm
4,5 = 365 nm
6,7 = 295 nm

both sipms given bias voltage of 29.0 V from teledyne ch1 (using bnc tee).
data files naming: c0r1v5 means LED channel 0, rate 1 MHz, voltage 5.00
scope: A=LED pulses (fires on falling edge), B & C=sipm signals s2 & s1 respectively
scale: 10 ns/div, A: 2 V, B & C: 500 mV
for channels 2 & 3, scale for B & C raised to 1 V
for voltages of 4 or 5, scale lowered to 50 mV

scratch all that, i did not choose time scales appropriately.
henceforth zoom in as much as possible.

scratch that, oscilloscope wasn't zeroed properly. the offset in one of the channels made the ptp look bigger. retaking data (but now without rings and cross and stuff)
the one with better coating (C) is biased to 29.3 V, the other (B) is still at 29
no idea how to disentangle and say whether it is weaker inherently or due to a thicker coating.
even after zeroing properly, after attaching the signal, the baselines differ by a bit (not too much though)
channel 1, 7 seem to not work
channel 3 has negligibly different effects from channel 2, these leds are probably identical (switching made one channel slightly weaker, so probably geometric effect)
channel 5 is quite brighter than channel 4 it seems (for both sipms so probably not from geometry)
